title = "Welcome!"

It is time for academic writing to step out of it's archaic ways and into the modern world! With the rise of Markdown as the de facto markup language of the internet, why should academia lag behind. You should be able to write scientific content, confident that it is publishable both physically and on the web, along with the comfort of knowing the content is readable in it's raw form and will stand the test of time.

## The issue with $\LaTeX$

[$\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org/) is incredible, but it has three key flaws.

- It's tooling is fractioned (to say the least).
- It is difficult to learn. 
- The syntax is very obscure.

The latter issue is exemplified on [it's own introduction page](https://www.latex-project.org/about/):

```tex
\documentclass{article}
\title{Cartesian closed categories and the price of eggs}
\author{Jane Doe}
\date{September 1994}
\begin{document}
   \maketitle
   Hello world!
\end{document}
```

All this for a simple hello world and a title... Compare that with the same document written in Markdown[^1]:

```markdown
Hello world!
```

I am obviously glossing over the information that each line in that example holds, but I would wager most LaTeX users are familiar with how much boilerplate is needed to get a working document. Additionally, the `\command{argument}` syntax is messy and hard to read. 

[^1]: Without the title, of course, but we'll get to that.
