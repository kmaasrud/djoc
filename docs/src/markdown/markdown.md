MDoc uses Pandoc Markdown (with a few carefully selected additions) as it's markup language. This choice was a simple one; the creator of Markdown, [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy), puts it best himself:

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

This is at the heart of most of my choices when creating MDoc, as I'm sure also was the case for [John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net/) when he made the canonical additions that make up Pandoc Markdown.

But why yet another Markdown flavor? Well, the goals of Pandoc, and subsequently of MDoc, is to produce a more complex output than a simple HTML page. To conform with the abovementioned philosophy, writing inline HTML or TeX (although permitted) to achieve this complexity, is simply not good enough. Thus, a few additions are needed, but should come as second nature to those already familiar with Markdown.

This part of the documentation contains a modified copy of [Pandoc's User Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). I've done this to explain the syntax at the perspective of MDoc's goals and to specify the changes and conventions MDoc introduces.
