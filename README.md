**The power of LaTeX and simplicity of Markdown**

MDoc is a document environment and command line tool for producing academic documents. It's main focus is on user-friendliness; you write your content in Markdown (which, frankly, is a whole lot more enjoyable than writing LaTeX), and MDoc handles the rest. MDoc also comes with a bunch of tools and additions that make your writing experience smoother and A LOT faster.
