**The power of LaTeX and simplicity of Djot**

[Installing](https://kmaasrud.com/djoc/installing) - [Documentation](https://kmaasrud.com/djoc/)

djoc is a document environment and command line tool for producing academic
documents. It's main focus is on user-friendliness; you write your content in
Djot (which, frankly, is a whole lot more enjoyable than writing LaTeX), and
djoc handles the rest. MDoc also comes with a bunch of tools and additions that
make your writing experience smoother and A LOT faster.
