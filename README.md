# djoc

the djot document compiler

</div>

djoc is a command-line tool that allows you to write documents in the markup
language [Djot](https://djot.net) and build them into a PDF or an HTML page.

djoc aims to simplify the process of document preparation by providing a modern
and user-friendly alternative to traditional TeX distributions. While TeX will
always hold a special place in the world of academic writing, its archaic syntax
and steep learning curve can be intimidating for many users. djoc aims to change
that by utilizing a simpler and more intuitive markup language, and handling the
complexity of TeX under the hood.

## Features

- Write documents in Djot, a markup language similar to Markdown with
  improvements such as TeX math, attributes and citations.
- Output documents as PDF, HTML, or LaTeX.
- Compile documents from a single file, or manage a project with multiple files.
- No need for external dependencies, as Tectonic (a TeX distribution) is fully
  embedded and any packages are downloaded and installed as needed.
