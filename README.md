Doctor is a document builder and command line tool that uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) coupled with a TeX engine to produce high-quality documents.

Doctor has it's main focus on user-friendliness. You write your content in Markdown (which, frankly, is a whole lot more enjoyable than writing LaTeX), and Doctor handles the rest. It also comes with a bunch of tools and additions that make your writing experience smoother and A LOT faster.
